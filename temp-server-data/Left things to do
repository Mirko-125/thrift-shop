Refactor the code and sort out the files
Home page - needs a couple of more details about articles + header updating + fix performance
Navbar - add finally the popup menu for clothing categories
	[
		Search, searching anything quickly right?
		Sign in should be a slider and if needed to register just to dynamicaly render it
		Favorites, if signed in it should redirect to favorites gallery if not redirection to sign in
		Same thing for bag, right?

Better API calls and filtering jsons
Now clothing should have it's own categories
+ when clicking on article it should show articles specific page with it's ALL properties, well data.
Accesories should be same thing as clothes
